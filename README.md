# Nexus Lorekeeper SPA REACT APP and Mock Json Server README
This is my DND Character generator Single Page React Application, submitted as part of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp Module 2 Project, February 2024 cohort.

## Technical Requirements
1. Create a Single Page Application (SPA), using React, consisting of multiple views.
2. The React application should be integrated with either a mock backend or an external API and should perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on that API.
3. The project should be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
4. The project should be available on a GitHub repository. If it includes a mock back-end API there should be two GitHub repositories:
    - front-end React application
    - back-end API.
5. Have at least 2 commits per day on the project repository.

## Deliverables
1. A working app that meets all technical requirements.
2. A working app deployed and accessible online.
3. The URLs of the GitHub repositories (frontend and mock backend).
4. The URL to the deployed React app.
5. The URL of the slides for the  project presentation.
6. Present and demo the app during the Project presentations.
